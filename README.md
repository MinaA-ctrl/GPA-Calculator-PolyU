# GPA-Calculator-PolyU
Calculator for counting GPA and Weighted GPA for PolyU students by entering own information. Base is for 4 years of study with two semester each. After creating a basis I want to add a function on adding an extra year if needed or summer terms to a year.

Functions of the programm:
 * Ability to enter the name of the subject in each semester with according amount of credits (maybe in the future create a data set for all subject PolyU offers to make choosing subjects assigning the credits automatic)
 * Enter letter mark of the subject manually to each subjects
 * Calculating gpa per semester
 * Calculating weighted GPA
 * Calculate GPA per all semester cumulatively

Ideas for the future:
 * Ability to provide information of what GPA a student should have next semesters if they want a N amount of gpa in the end of the course
